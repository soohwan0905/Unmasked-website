            1. Is it really anonymous?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes! The app is completely anonymous with one exception. ONLY in the event of serious perceived threats to self or others will we provide local law enforcement with access to personally identifiable information. No one directly associated with the app will have access to user data. All user data is encrypted.

            Yes! We have a team of Unmasked moderators, who have gone through Dickâ€™s House-certified mental health peer support training, that will regularly review content on the app. Please use flagging and direct message reporting features if you ever run into malicious content.
